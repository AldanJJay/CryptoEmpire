FACTIONS PLANNING

TODO descriptions

Faction 1: Agriculturists - Green
+ Immune to poor harvest
- Generates 75% of the usual zeal
Using techniques passed down through the generations, the Agriculturists are able to sustain their populace through famine
and indeed through feast. Some of this land's greatest delicacies are grown by these humble people, who insist that anyone
could grow what they do, winking at one another as they say it. Without the spectre of hunger on the horizon, the Agriculturists
lead the slow life, indulging in pleasures at their own pace.

Faction 2: Capitalists - Yellow
+ Immune to recession
- Satisfaction drops by double if below harvest boundary
The sky-high towers and luxurious dwellings found throughout their cities represent the Capitalists to the fullest. They
value the clink of coins over anything else, and it has served them well so far. However, if you take a look around the
corner, things are clearly not as the seem. And as the slums fill up, there better be enough food to go around, lest
something... dangerous happens.

Faction 3: Scrutineers - Light blue
+ Always finds something in investigations
- Generates 75% of the usual fortune
Due to a genetic trait, the Scrutineers have always had good eyesight and they use it to full effect. Nothing gets past
them, from the temples of the outlands to the streets of their cities. But, as it goes, the devil is in the details, as
the local clergy certainly aren't exempt from the all-seeing eye, with blessings being stymied as much as is humanly
possible.

Faction 4: The Godless - Cyan
+ Generates 125% of the usual wealth
- Blessings are 150% of the usual cost
Many eons ago, a subsection of the population of these lands began to question the effectiveness of their blessings
after years of squalor and oppression. They shook free their bonds and formed their own community based around the one
thing that proved valuable to all people: currency. However, despite shunning blessings at every opportunity, The
Godless, as they became known, are wont to dabble in blessings in moments of weakness, and what's left of their clergy
makes sure to sink the boot in.
