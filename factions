FACTIONS PLANNING

TODO descriptions

Faction 1: Agriculturists - Green
+ Immune to poor harvest
- Generates 75% of the usual zeal
Using techniques passed down through the generations, the Agriculturists are able to sustain their populace through famine
and indeed through feast. Some of this land's greatest delicacies are grown by these humble people, who insist that anyone
could grow what they do, winking at one another as they say it. Without the spectre of hunger on the horizon, the Agriculturists
lead the slow life, indulging in pleasures at their own pace.

Faction 2: Capitalists - Yellow
+ Immune to recession
- Satisfaction drops by double if below harvest boundary
The sky-high towers and luxurious dwellings found throughout their cities represent the Capitalists to the fullest. They
value the clink of coins over anything else, and it has served them well so far. However, if you take a look around the
corner, things are clearly not as the seem. And as the slums fill up, there better be enough food to go around, lest
something... dangerous happens.

Faction 3: Scrutineers - Light blue
+ Always finds something in investigations
- Generates 75% of the usual fortune
Due to a genetic trait, the Scrutineers have always had good eyesight and they use it to full effect. Nothing gets past
them, from the temples of the outlands to the streets of their cities. But, as it goes, the devil is in the details, as
the local clergy certainly aren't exempt from the all-seeing eye, with blessings being stymied as much as is humanly
possible.

Faction 4: The Godless - Cyan
+ Generates 125% of the usual wealth
- Blessings are 150% of the usual cost
Many eons ago, a subsection of the population of these lands began to question the effectiveness of their blessings
after years of squalor and oppression. They shook free their bonds and formed their own community based around the one
thing that proved valuable to all people: currency. However, despite shunning blessings at every opportunity, The
Godless, as they became known, are wont to dabble in blessings in moments of weakness, and what's left of their clergy
makes sure to sink the boot in.

Faction 5: The Ravenous - Lime
+ Generates 125% of the usual harvest
- Settlements are capped at level 5
Originating from a particular fertile part of these lands, The Ravenous have enjoyed bountiful harvests for centuries.
No matter the skill of the farmer, or the quality of the seeds, a cultivation of significant size is always created
after some months. But with such consistency, comes complacency. Those that have resided in settlements occupied by The
Ravenous, over time, grow greedy. As populations increase, and more food is available, the existing residents seek to
keep it all for themselves, as newcomers are given the unbearable choice of starving or leaving.

Faction 6: Fundamentalists - Orange
+ Generates 125% of the usual zeal
- Construction buyouts are disabled
There's nothing quite like the clang of iron striking iron to truly ground a person in their surroundings. This is a
fact that the Fundamentalists know well, as every child of a certain age is required to serve as an apprentice in a
local forge or refinery. With such resources at their disposal, work is done quickly. And yet, suggestions that
constructions should be made quicker, and in some cases instantaneous, through the use of empire funds are met with
utter disgust by the people. For the Fundamentalists, everything must be done the right way.

Faction 7: The Orthodox - Purple
