### Testing

There are no tests in the wild west.

### Environment details

To contribute to Microcosm, first create a fork of the repository into your own GitHub account.
For development, Python 3.9 as well as the requirements defined in requirements.txt are needed.

Please note that all changes should be made on a branch *other* than main.

### Submitting pull requests

When you're satisfied that you have completed an issue, or have made another valuable contribution, put up a pull request for review.
You should receive a response in a day or two, and a full review by the weekend at the latest.

### If you find a bug

Hey, none of us are perfect. So, if you find a bug in the game, add a new issue [here](https://github.com/ChrisNeedham24/microcosm/issues/new).
Any submitted issues of this kind should have the bug label, so be sure to mention in the issue description that the label should be applied.

If you're not sure whether something classifies as a bug, just suggest the 'almost a bug' label instead.

### What to try first

Any issue with either of the 'hacktoberfest' or 'good first issue' labels will be a good start.

### Additional features

If you have a dream for Microcosm that isn't adequately captured in existing issues, add a new issue [here](https://github.com/ChrisNeedham24/microcosm/issues/new).
If you think the feature may require some significant work, be sure to mention that in the issue description as well.

### Style guide

Microcosm broadly follows [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) styling.
Pylint is also used to guarantee conformity.
If you're ever unsure whether you've formatted something correctly, run `pylint *.py` in the repository's root directory.
