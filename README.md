# Microcosm
Just a little 4X game written in Python using the library [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).
Inspiration taken from games I've played.

## Pre-requisites
Playing Microcosm requires an installation of VLC media player on the player's machine. Installation instructions for
your favourite operating system can be found [here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). If your operating system lists
python-vlc (or something like that) as an optional dependency, it is advised that players also install that. Naturally,
Python is also required, at version 3.10 or above.

## Play from source

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ChrisNeedham24/microcosm/releases/latest)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `pyxel run microcosm`

## Wiki

The Wiki can be viewed both [on GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisNeedham24/microcosm/wiki) and in-game.
